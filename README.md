## Goal

You start as a small cell in a big world, and your goal is simply to survive until you are the last alive. You can absorb cells smaller than you, but be careful because bigger ones can absorb you.

Tap on the arrow keys or w-a-s-d to move, but be aware, every action has a cost. With each propulsion you will see a little bit of your body leave to provide the momentum and your overall size shrink. It is a balancing game to maintain your momentum, but not let it take you into your own death.

## Implementation Details

#### Hand Rolled Collision Detection

#### 'Shrinking' algorithm

#### Calculating placement of propulsion pieces
